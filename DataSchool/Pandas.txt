1.Tips:
Read Pandas.read_table
skiprows and skipfooter
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.25.0/reference/api/pandas.read_table.html
Tabular data just looks like a data with rows and columns

2.Object Types:
Series
Data frames- table of rows and columns- pandas series

head()- First 5 rows
tail() - Last 5 rows

read_csv vs read_table
read_csv - Used the comma as a default seperator

3. .notation works only certain circumstances where [] notation works well for all cases
describe()- shows descriptive statistics of all numeric columns
Parantheses funcions               No parantheses
head()					shape
describe()				dtypes

4.Attributes are the descrptions that will be without parantheses such as shape,dtypes
Methods are actions
if it starts with pd. then its a function

5.axis is a direction
axis 0, row axis,default
axis 1, columns axis

6.pandas dataframe - table of data, rows and columns
series- single column from a data frame

7.When should you use group by
Anytime you want to analyze some pandas series by some category

8.tail() - Last 5 rows
Nan - stands for Not a Number, conceptually its a missing values

10.Index and columns

Index:It's for identification, we can identify what rows we can working with
0
1
2
3
4

Columns:
Country beer_serviongs spirit_servings

loc- filtering rows and selecting columns by label.Label(Rows->Index, Column->Columns)
loc inclusive on both sides

iloc -  filtering rows and selecting columns by integer position
inclusive of first number and exclusive of the last number
ix - mix labels and integers

10. inplace
inplace=True, affects underlined data
See the impact without affecting then inplace==False

rename()
sort_values()
set_index()


Questions
a.What about reading from csv file only two columns and ignore others?
b.What is the fastest method to read from csv file?
c.How to define type of each column before actually reading the csv

Method	File format
pandas.read_table()	Tab separated values (TSV)
pandas.read_excel()	Excel spreadsheets
pandas.read_csv()	Comma separated values (CSV)
pandas.read_json()	JSON files
pandas.read_html()	HTML files
pandas.read_sql_query()	SQL Database



11."Axis" Parameter in pandas

axis=1 -> Column axis
axis=0 -> Row axis

Eg: titanic.mean()

Default behaviour of mean is axis = 0

12.String Method in pandas
.str - the string method that we use in pandas

13.Change the data type of pandas series
dtype is the method that we used to convert the datatype of a particular series

astype - casting from one data type to another

14.Using "groupby" in pandas
Anytime you want to analyze some pandas series by some category

15.Exploring pandas series

16.Handle Missing values in pandas

Nan - stands for Not a Number, conceptually its a missing values.
sum is doing by axis=0 by default
For dropping, inplace=False is default

17.Pandas index part-1

Vertical - Columns-
Horizontal -rows

Index are known as row labels

0
1
2
3
4

Columns
Country beer_servings spirit_servings

Every dataframe has index and column
Eg: drinks.shape
(193,6)  193, rows   6,columns

18.Pandas index part-1
Why index exists?
a.Identification,Selection,Alignment
Identification- Filtering the data frames.

b.Selection(loc) - Grabbing a piece of data frame
loc- filtering rows and selecting columns by label.Label(Rows->Index, Column->Columns)
loc inclusive on both sides

c.Alignment-

19.Selecting multiple rows and columns from pandas dataframe
loc- filtering rows and selecting columns by label.Label(Rows->Index, Column->Columns)
loc is inclusive on both sides

iloc -  filtering rows and selecting columns by integer position
inclusive on the start and exclusive of stop

ix - It allows you to mix labels and integers

20.Using "inplace" parameter in pandas
The drop method has inplace parameters which is False by default.

Example Functions
rename()
sort_values()
set_index()

21.Making pandas DataFrame smaller and faster
What does the type category do?How to properly use it?
info() - tells about index,not null,datatypes
Objects usually means a string is stored
we can store arbitary python objects in a pandas series and pandas basically stores reference.
object columns will take lot of space
Integers are more space efficient than strings

22.Using pandas with Scikit-learn to create kaggle submissions
kaggle - It is a popular platform for doing competitive machine learning
Machine Learning - It is the semi automated extraction of knowledge from data

Save python object to disk

23.Questions
1.How to read the pandas doc

2.It looks like ufo.isnull() and pd.isnull(ufo) has the same result, but one is calling a function of the object and the other 
is using the object as argument.Is this a special case because isnull takes in the dataset as argument?

3.It seems to me that the pandas team is split between inclusive and exclusive ranges. 0:4 is different from loc to iloc.
Do you know what the reasoning is behind this

pandas is built on top of numpy.It follows numpy conventions

4.How to handle large csv files?(Over 3GB).Is there a practical way to randomly sample rows?

24.Create dummy variables in pandas

25.Working with dates and times in pandas

26.Find and Remove duplicate row in pandas

27.Avoid a SettingWithCopyWarning in pandas

28.Changing Display options in pandas

29.How to create pandas dataframe from another object
How do you create dataframe from scratch i.e. without reading a file?This is handy when you
want to create some toy data to play around with.There are several different ways to
construct a DataFrame and its confusing to find the best method.

Specifically, need to construct a DataFrame with specific columns in specific order.
Using the dict constructor, the order cannot be enforced.

30.Applying a function to pandas Series or DataFrame
Question: Difference between apply,map and applymap

map() is a series method, which maps the existing values of a Series to a different set of values
apply() is both series and dataframe method, it applies a function to each element in series

apply() as a dataframe method applies a function along either axis of a dataframe

applymap() is also a dataframe method.It is to apply function to every element of a dataframe.

31.Using MultiIndex in pandas
Could you please elaborate on multiIndexing,how does it relate to group by?How do slice a multiindex table?
How do concetenate on more than one level
